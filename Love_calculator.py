# ðŸ’¡ "Love Calculator" Challenge
# Write a Python program that:

# Takes two names as input.
# Counts the occurrences of the letters in "TRUE LOVE" in both names.
# Combines the counts to form a "love percentage" (just for fun).
# Outputs the love percentage as a percentage value (e.g., 42%).
#
# ðŸ’¡ Example Input/Output
#   
# :
# Input: "John" "Mary"
# Output: "Your love score is 72%."
#
# ðŸ’¡ Example Input/Output
# Th function

    # Define the letters in "TRUE LOVE"
    love_letters = "TRUELOVE"
    # 
    # Initialize counters for each letter in "TRUE LOVE"
