# ðŸ’¡ "Love Calculator" Challenge
# Write a Python program that:

# Takes two names as input.
# Counts the occurrences of the letters in "TRUE LOVE" in both names.
# Combines the counts to form a "love percentage" (just for fun).

def love_calculator(name1, name2):
    # Define the letters in "TRUE LOVE"
    love_letters = "TRUELOVE"
    
    # Initialize counters for each letter in "TRUE LOVE"
    love_count = {letter: 0 for letter in love_letters}
    
    # Count the occurrences of each letter in "TRUE LOVE" in both names
    for name in [name1, name2]:
        for letter in love_letters:
            love_count[letter] += name.lower().count(letter)
    
    # Combine the counts to form a "love percentage"
    love_percentage = sum(love_count.values()) % 100  # Ensure percentage is within 0-99
    
    # Output the love percentage as a percentage value
    return f"Your love score is {love_percentage}%."

# Test the function with example inputs
print(love_calculator("John", "Mary"))
print(love_calculator("Alice", "Bob"))
print(love_calculator("Michael", "Sarah"))
